## Questions
### Describe how Kotlin handles null safety. What are nullable types and non-null types in Kotlin? (0,5 points)

<span style="color:blue">Kotlin handles null safety in different ways:
- Safe Calls: the '?.' operator can be used to safely access properties or methods of nullable types. If the property is null the expression returns null rather than throwing an exception
- Elvis Operator: the '?:' operator returns the left-hand operand if it's not null, otherwise it returns the right-hand.
- Safe Casts: the 'as?' operator returns null if the casting would return a ClassCastException.
- Not-null Assertion: the '!!' operator converts nullable types to non-nullable types. However if the operation is null it throws a NullPointer Exception, so its usage should be limited</span>
> Note: you can also use code snippets to illustrate your answer. 

```kotlin 
// example code snippet
val a: String = "value" // non-null type
```

### What are lambda expressions and higher order functions in Kotlin? Why would you store a function inside a variable? (0,5 points)

<span style="color:blue">Lambda:
- Lambda expressions in Kotlin are anonymous functions that appear as values.
- They are defined by curly braces and '->' operand.
- Lambda expressions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.
- Lambda expressions enable functional-style programing
Higher-Order Functions:
- ...are functions that can tyke other functions as parameters and/or return functions
- They allow code to be more modular and flexible by using abstraction of behavior
- Higher-Order Functions enable the implementation of callbacks, event handling, and asynchronous programing
Storing Functions inside vars:
- Makes code more abstract and modular
- Enables dynamic behavior</span>

### Provide a solution for the following number guessing game inside `App.kt`. (3 points)

## Number Guessing Game in Kotlin
The game is a simple number guessing game. The task is to generate a random, max 9-digit, number. The number must **not contain repeating digits**. Valid digits are 1-9.
Ask the user to guess the max 9-digit number. The game is finished when the user guesses the correct digits in the correct order.
In each round, the user gets feedback about the number of correct digits and the number of correct digits in the correct position.
The output should be in the format "n:m", where "n" is the number of digits guessed correctly regardless of their position, 
and "m" is the number of digits guessed correctly at their correct position. Here are some examples:

This example shows the game flow with 4-digits to guess (the default argument)

Generated number: 8576
-	User input: 1234, Output: 0:0
-	User input: 5678, Output: 4:1
-	User input: 5555, Output: 1:1
-	User input: 3586, Output: 3:2
-	User input: 8576, Output: 4:4 -> user wins

Take a look into the provided code structure in `src/main/kotlin/App.kt`. Implement the following methods (lambda expressions):
- _playNumberGame(digitsToGuess: Int = 4)_ (1 point): The main game loop that handles user input and game state. Make use of _generateRandomNonRepeatingNumber_ and _checkUserInputAgainstGeneratedNumber_ here. This function also utilizes a default argument 
- _generateRandomNonRepeatingNumber_ (1 point): A lambda expression that generates a random number with non-repeating digits of a specified length.
- _checkUserInputAgainstGeneratedNumber_ (1 point): A lambda expression that compares the user's input against the generated number and provides feedback.

``CompareResult.kt`` This class is a data structure which helps with bundling the result of the comparison of the user input and the generated number. Look at the toSting() and use it in your output.

Run the project with `./gradlew run` and test your implementation with the provided tests in `src/test/kotlin/AppTest.kt` with `./gradlew test`.

# Project Structure
The project is structured into two main Kotlin files:

**App.kt**: Contains the main game logic and functions.

**AppTest.kt**: Contains unit tests for the various functions in App.kt.
